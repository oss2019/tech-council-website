# Technical Council Website
This is the official repository for the technical council website for IIT Dharwad.
Currently, the website has been build as a single page application with React.js

There are two things that we need to do in this website.

- [ ] Add routing to the website
- [ ] Make the website responsive

Routing here, means simply adding a smooth scrolling to the section on clicking the link on the header.
For more information, please check the issues.

Please read the CONTRIBUTING.md file before contributing just so that you get to know the folder structure and other minute details regarding the project.
