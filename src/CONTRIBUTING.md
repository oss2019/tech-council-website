For contributing to the project, first go to the issue that you want to take up and add a comment so that we know you are working on it. Please do not take up issues in which other people are working already.
Once you are assigned to the issue, you can start working.

To do so, fork the repository, make a branch in the fork and add your code in there.
Once done, push your changes and submit a PR (pull request). We will verify your work post that and merge if it is correctly done.
